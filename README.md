# The Girl Who Knew Time

:sparkles: For the past two years that I've started an indie game studio ([TrinityMoon Studios](https://www.trinitymoonstudios.com/))—I self-taught myself `C#` and `Unity`, created dozens of managements systems, features, and `.txt`-based language using `C#`. I also managed artist and animator contractors from various skills and backgrounds while developing the game.

:sparkles:**The Girl Who Knew Time** is a story I wrote, managed and developed. **Check out Episode 01 trailer below:**

## :herb: About the game

#### Summary
**The Girl Who Knew Time** is an interactive experience game where your choices impact the story. Every choice effects your relationship with the main characters and shapes the story. 

Featuring gorgeous cinematic visuals, enchanting characters, and an enthralling story full of twists and unexpected turns.

Guide Catherine—a determined young woman—to save her world from perishing. You have exactly seven days before she and her close friends(the main characters) die.

**Can you save them, find true love and discover the truth plaguing Catherine's world?**

#### Development

:books:The first year I focused on learning `C#`, `Unity`, and managing all the art and animation that game needs. Every single detail of every asset took much more time than anticipate to create. Just the first episode alone has over 70 total assets(there are 5 episodes).

The Prologue was released in October.

After a short break, Episode 01 had a ton of new features so it took about 5 months to develop and was released in July 2021. Currently I am dedicating all my time to web development while working on this project part-time. 

**:star2: DEMO Includes(FREE):**
* Prologue
* Episode 01 *(Soon will be free, as stated above, currently you have to pay)*

**:star2: FULL GAME(Will work on Episode 02-05 part-time):**
* Prologue
* Episode 01 - 05

> ##### :warning: Please Note:
> * As it stands you can play the Prologue for free and purchase Episode 01 within the game. (In about 1-2 weeks I will remove in-app purchases and make Episode 01 free—it will be part of the Demo.) 
> * **Once all Episodes are completed later this year, I will have another app release with the full-game**. So you'll only have to purchase it once to get all the episodes.

## :herb: About the code

**The full codebase is private and located on the company’s GitHub page. You can see the activity [here](https://github.com/devtrinitymoonstudios).**

I’ve included bits and pieces of several management systems I’ve implemented just to showcase some of the features I worked on.

> ##### :warning: If you try to serve the files in anyway or load them you will see errors and it will not work because:
> * Some of the management systems have dependencies(either files I did not include or third-party libraries).
> * Some private code was removed from the files so you might see errors.
> * Purpose of this repo is to showcase some of the work I did to give an idea of my work ethic, not to actually show how the entire game works(this is private).
